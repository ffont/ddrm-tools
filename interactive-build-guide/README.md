# Deckard's Dream DIY synth (unofficial) interactive build guide

Open the interactive build guide here: https://ffont.github.io/ddrm-interactive-build-guide.

Info about Deckard's Dream DIY synth: http://www.deckardsdream.com/.

An official work in progress build guide is provided at http://www.deckardsdream.com/build. I prepared this (unofficial) interactive version of it to help with the building process. Currently this is only a beta version, waiting for the final version of the oficial build guide to be released so that this one can be updated with all the information.

This interactive build guide could potentially incorporate other documentation like the published schematics or other documetns created by the community, but so far is only limited to the build pictures.
